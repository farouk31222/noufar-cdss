## Overview

NOUFAR CDSS is a full-stack clinical decision support platform with two distinct interfaces:

- **Doctor App** — a secure, role-based clinical workflow for running and reviewing hyperthyroidism relapse predictions
- **Admin Console** — a management dashboard for approving doctors, reviewing profiles, and handling support requests

The AI inference engine runs a trained ensemble model (Random Forest + Logistic Regression + Deep Neural Network) with explainability outputs for each prediction.
